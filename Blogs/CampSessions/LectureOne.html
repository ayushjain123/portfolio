            <h1>CLI App : Introduction To Programming</h1>
            <p>On first day of Neog Camp, as everyone knows this camp is totally for beginners. The first thing that was to be taught was making CLI app using JS
                from scratch So question arises</p>
                <p>What is a CLI app?</p>
                <p>Full form of CLI(Command Line Interface) what CLI does it it asks user for input app processes input to form a desired output but all this without GUI(Graphical User Interface). CLI app has many uses in securities most of tools are made for CLI either using python,go,ruby etc. 
                    <br></p>
                    <p>but as i said INPUT,PROCESSING,OUTPUT these three words justify a whole program, these are the parts which every program have for example.</p>
                    <ul class="list list-non-bullet">
                        <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/IP_OP_P.png" alt=""></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Then Comes making CLI app using Node.js. First things that comes to mind is what is the syntax for Node.js syntax of Node is similar to JavaScript but here to take input we import library. Now what is library so a thinking it in literal english so in normal world what is library, library has many books which one can refer or read. Similar to that library programming library also have collection of resources which one can use to get one particular piece of work done</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All these Codes were written on online editor <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a></p>
                    <h1>User Input</h1>
                    <p>First program was <strong>Print Your Name</strong></p>
                    <ul class="list list-non-bullet">
                        <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/question1.png" alt=""></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1>Concatenation</h1>
                    <p>Second Goal was to learn String Concatenation By Welcoming User</p>
                    <ul class="list list-non-bullet">
                        <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/question2.png" alt=""></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Usually this plus sign is used to add numbers but in string this operator is used to append a string to existing</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Conditional Operator</h1>
                    <p>
                        Then comes conditional operators the most important part of program. So What are conditional statements. These statements are a way to choose the correct value or a desired out put in a certain conditions
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list list-non-bullet">
                        <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/question3.png" alt=""></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1>Increment Decrement</h1>
                    <p>Next Comes Increment And Decrement.</p>
                    <ul class="list list-non-bullet">
                        <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/question4.png" alt=""></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This Program alone has 3 concepts</p>
                   
                    <p>1) Comparision 2)Increment 3) Method toUpperCase()</p>
                    <p>So What does toUpperCase() do this method converts a lower case string to upper case, and this method is used to prevent or handel different input as we have hardcoded the answer what if user gives input : InDore Or INdore Or indore, so to make input and coded ans similar we make take both on same level</p>

                    <p>Next Increment, incrementing is adding another value to an existing value values can be incremented in different ways <strong>a=a+1 OR a += 1 OR a ++ </strong> all these works same</p>
                    <p>JavaScript uses three `=` signs to compare with datatype and 2 equal does not check datatype</p>

                    <br>
                    <h1>Functions</h1>
                    <p>Next Functions, Functions are piece of code or can say when a problem is divided into different parts it forms a function, it imporves tidyness of code and prevents repeating of code</p>
                    <ul class="list list-non-bullet">
                        <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/question5.png" alt=""></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These are two types of functions one take parameter and second one doesn't take any parameter, what parameter means is to pass a value to that piece of code which that code can implement function includes concepts of global and local variable, <strong>“  A variable inside a function stays inside a function unless its global ”</strong> that means a variable declared inside a function cannot be used by other functions unless its global or its passed as parameter</p>
                    <h1>Loops</h1>
                    <p>
                        Loops the another most important concept, loop is expression for repeating something until and unless the condition is satisfied
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list list-non-bullet">
                        <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/question6.png" alt=""></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        There are three types of loops While() Do..While() & for() while loop is kind of similar to for loop as it checks condition before entering body but Do..While() is executed once in any condition.
                    </p>
                    <p>So in this loop arrows explains it well but the first initialization step is done then it checks wether the initialized variable is satisfying given condition if yes it executes body and after executing body it increments the variable. All this continues till condition is satisfied</p>
                </p>

                <ul class="list list-non-bullet">
                    <li class="list-items-inline">1) initialization</li>
                    <li class="list-items-inline">2) Condition Check</li>
                    <li class="list-items-inline">3) Execute Body</li>
                    <li class="list-items-inline">4) Increment Variable</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Data-structure : Array</h1>
                <p>
                    First question arises what is Data-structure so data structure is nothing but arranging data in a particular way by which its easy to fetch the stored data.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Array basically is a linear Data-structure. Now storing values in an array. It 'SQUARE BRACKETS [..]'</p>
                <ul class="list list-non-bullet">
                    <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/question7.png" alt=""></li>
                </ul>
                <p>It follows particular indexing which starts form 0 to n to get first element we call 0 index</p>
                <h1>List</h1>
                <p>As we have seen array stores a single value without ref to store value with ref we use dictionary wich consists of key & value pair we can call a value by its key name. it uses 'CURLY BRACKETS {..}'</p>
                <ul class="list list-non-bullet">
                    <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/question8.png" alt=""></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The <strong>'DOT . '</strong> fetches value inside an object here 'key' is inside 'dict'</p>
                <h1>Now Another Goal is To Create A Quiz Using All the Concepts Discussed Above. Input,Concatenation,Loops,Conditional Statements, List, Dictionary</h1>
