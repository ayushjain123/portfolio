            <h1>Hosting Our First Website</h1>
            <h3>So, Before we start hosting our website on "WEB" lets first understand what "WEB" is, how even if we host our web site we'll be able to fetch it, how does browser gets us our desired content how?????</h3>
            <p>Have you ever heard about that chacha in family who just tries to fix everyone's marriage!! . How is it related to our question?</p>
            <p>It is related to our question, the way he gets rishta's for a person, this is exactly how browser works it gets to the server asks him <strong>Hey Do You Have Any Rishta Which Matches My Nephew's Requirement?</strong> Here `nephew` is client `rishta` is request which we made through browser(chacha), if server replies with yes it picks up all the content which we asked and puts it in our browser(client).</p>
            <h3>Now question arises, what is a server then?</h3>
            <p>A server provides data to different computers(CLIENT) and also, Server Sometimes act as mediators also. Its not necessary that server are BIG or have much storage capacity your PC can also be converted into a server.</p>
            <h3>In the process of deploying/hosting our website we understood how WEB works. Now comes another step to store the application which we create or to manage versions of our application</h3>
            
            <p><strong>To manage these things we use </strong><a href="https://github.com/">GIT</a> This application lets us store our application, track changes, view change history, invite different collaborators and deploy</p>
            <p><strong>lets Start with creating account on GIT</strong></p>
            <ul class="social-links list-non-bullet">
                <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/GIT/AC.png" style="max-width: 400px;" alt=""></li>
   
                <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/GIT/Verify.png"  style="max-width: 400px;" alt=""></li>
    
                <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/GIT/email.png"  style="max-width: 400px;" alt=""></li>

                <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/GIT/title.png"  style="max-width: 400px;" alt=""></li>
               </ul>
               <p>after completing all these steps you are ready to create a repository</p>
               <h2>What repository is now?</h2>
               <p>Repository is a folder that contains all the files of your application. Repositories can be public or private, public repositories are visible and can be cloned by others and private repository can be seen by a collaborator or owner</p>
               <h2>Now Creating Repository</h2>
               <ul class="social-links list-non-bullet">
                <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/GIT/Repository.png" style="max-width: 400px;" alt=""></li></ul>
                <p>README.md file is a markdown file which acts as html but is easily understandable by git and git converts text inside md file into a proper texts</p>
                <p>gitignore is used to ignore some confidential files while pushing our code</p>
            <p>After creating repository you will see thi type of interface.</p>
            <ul class="social-links list-non-bullet">
                <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/GIT/commands.png" style="max-width: 400px;" alt=""></li></ul>
            <h3>Lets now understand how git works before getting into all these commands</h3>
            <p>GIT is a storage like Google Drive as we add our photos to google drive after creating account, similarly we add our file stored in our system locally and upload it on GIT</p>
            <ul class="social-links list-non-bullet">
                <li class="list-items-inline"><img src="Images/GIT/gitDia.png" style="max-width: 400px;" alt=""></li></ul>
            <p>so now blurry picture of these commands will get a bit clear. By using these commands we tell our mediator GIT application to track all the changes we are making in a file while we code and after we are done coding we push our code to github</p>
            <h3>lets understand these commands now</h3>
            <p><strong>git init</strong> This command allows git application to track that repository and initialises it with .git like any othe extension</p>
            <p><strong>git remote add origin ["GIT_URL"]</strong> By this command we tell our GIT application where to push all the code</p>
            <h2>You dont need to put commands mentioned above every time, these commands are entered when a repository is to be initialized</h2>
            <p><strong>git add . </strong> this command adds all the files present in folder to GIT application and then git application keeps track of every single change until we commit all these changes</p>
            <p><strong>git commit -m "[COMMIT-MESSAGE]"</strong> this command finally saves every file. While commiting changes it is necessary to provide a commit message to track changes easily.</p>
            <p><strong>NOTE: ALL THESE COMMANDS ARE FOR GIT TERMINAL</strong></p>
            <h3>Writing a good commit message itself is an art</h3>
            <p>These are some commit message notations</p>
                        <ul class="social-links list-non-bullet"><img src="Images/GIT/commit.png" alt="">
                <li class="list-items-inline"></li></ul>
            <p>Finally after saving all the changes only thing left is to push every thing on github using this command. <strong>git push origin master</strong> now two question arises what is `origin` & `master`. So origin is local branch which we created while adding repository link master is github branch in which particular changes are updated</p>
            <p>A repository can have many branches. These branches are used to work on different versions as while working in a team work is divided, to collaborate all the work together or to bifurcate the work branches are used </p>
            <h3>Final Stage Of Deploying Site</h3>
            <p>Website can be deployed by either purchasing a domain or with free domain web hosting platform</p>
            <p>For this example I am using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a></p>
            <p>When we get into the site we get an option to link our account with github after we link our account, we can choose a repository from git to deploy</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that your repository must have index.html to deploy a webapp.</p>
            <p>after adding repository you can check your deployed site from `Sites` in nav bar</p>
            <p>Link of your app may look wierd but you can rename that by going in `Site Settings` under `general` you can change your site name</p>
            <h2>Congratulations!! You Have Deployed Your Site</h2>
